# AI Video Analyzer and Chat Agent

## Overview
This project is a multimodal GenAI application that analyzes video content and enables users to interact with it using natural language. It combines video understanding, conversational AI, and web search fallback to deliver context-aware responses.

## Features
- Video content analysis using Google Gemini API  
- Natural language interaction with uploaded videos  
- Conversational AI chat agent for follow-up questions  
- Web search fallback using DuckDuckGo for external knowledge  

## Tech Stack
Streamlit, Google Gemini API, LangChain, Agno Agent Framework, DuckDuckGo Search

## How It Works
1. User uploads a video  
2. Gemini API analyzes visual and contextual information  
3. Chat agent answers user queries based on video context  
4. External web search is used when internal context is insufficient  

## Use Cases
- Video summarization  
- Content understanding  
- Educational and media analysis  
- Interactive video-based Q&A  

## Future Enhancements
- Timestamp-based responses  
- Multi-video comparison  
- Memory-enabled conversational agents
